# HungryRobot
Make a Hungry Robot with **Cytron Maker Pi Pico board**, a distance sensor and a servo.  

This is based on the tutorial presented at **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfP_LfUiwdc** as suggested by Michael Creggan.

Funding has been provided curtesy of the Teaching Innovation Fund.

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**  P6/P7 Children
**SCHOOLS:** Possibly Fane Primary School
****GROUP SIZE:** 20
LENGTH OF WORKSHOP**: 90 minutes
**VENUE:** Farset Labs?
**DATE:** TBA
**TIME:** TBA

**TO DO:**  LINK TO CURRICULUM CCEA and the stages and LEARNING OBJECTIVES

**HARDWARE:**

Cytron Maker Pi Pico Board donated by Michael Creggan
IR distance Sensors
Servos
Cable Ties

Information on the Cytron Maker Pi Pico Board can be found here: ** https://github.com/CytronTechnologies/MAKER-PI-PICO/tree/main**.

**SOFTWARE**

Example code provided for Arduino :  https://github.com/happythingsmaker/TrashEatingRobot   

We will need to choose an **IDE** for development purposes.

The Thonny app is the orginal suggestion:  **https://thonny.org/**

It may be useful to evaluate other methods to code using blocks  for instance using: https://wokwi.com/pi-pico or https://mindplus.dfrobot.com/

**LANGUAGE:**  Micropython or Circuit Python or Block Coding?  

**SETTING UP MICROPYTHON:**  I have orginally added prototype code for Micropython.  To use Micropython on the board I choose Configure Interpreter from the Run Menu.  I selected Micropython Raspberry Pi Pico as the interpreter and tried to detect the port automatically.  I clicked on the link Install or Update Micropython.  It tells you to plug in the board while pressing the BOOTSEL button on the green Pico board to enter bootlaoder mode and then you can select the version of MicroPython you require.

**CONNECTING THE SOFTWARE TO THE HARDWARE:**  I have connected the analog servo to Grove 1 and the IR detector to Grove 4 whilst using the prototype code.
